Simple_Shell

In computing, a shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system (OS) kernel. It allows users to interact with the system by entering text commands, which the shell interprets and executes on their behalf.

A shell typically includes a command-line interface (CLI) that accepts typed commands from the user and provides feedback in the form of text output. The commands entered by the user can be simple, such as changing directories or listing files, or complex, such as running scripts or executing programs.

There are different types of shells available in different operating systems, such as bash, zsh, and fish on Linux and Unix systems, and PowerShell on Windows. Each shell has its own set of commands, syntax, and features. Shells are an essential tool for system administrators, developers, and power users who need to perform various tasks on their systems quickly and efficiently.

And in this repo we'll be trying to create our own shell. steps to the project:

1. Sence we're not allowed to use all the standard libray functions we'll start by writing our own functions.
2. We'll make betty proud.
3. We tried to handle the path.
4. Handle the exit command.
5. set and unset environment
6. create a gitline function.
7. Implement the builtin command cd.
8. Implement the alias builtin command.
9. Handle variables replacement
10. Handle comments (#).
11. Handle history.
12. Handle Errors.
13. Manage memory and prevent leaks.
